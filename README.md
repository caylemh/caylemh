### Hi there, I'm Caylem Harris ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer, hoping to make some solid progress into the developer world. I started my developer career quite late in life but I've come to the obvious conclusion that no one is too old to learn right! 

- ðŸŒ± I completed the Odin Project: Foundation Course :white_check_mark:
- I'm currently completing the Odin Project: Javascript Path
  1. Completed the Intermediate HTML and CSS section :white_check_mark:
  2. Started the Javascript section

I love God, my family, coffee &... Did I mention I LOOOOVVVE :coffee: :grin:!!!
