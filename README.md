### Hi there, I'm Caylem Harris ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Java Developer, hoping to make quick inrodes into the developer world. I started my developer career quite late in life but I've come to the obvious conclusion that no one is too old to learn right! 

I love God, my family, coffee &... Did I mention I LOOOOVVVE :coffee: :grin:!!!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and implementing React Native with AWS Backend. ðŸ˜‰
